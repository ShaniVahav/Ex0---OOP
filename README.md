######An Off-line Elevator Algorithm

### About the project.
Given a `building`, with a maximum floor and a minimum floor, and with smart elevators (ie: [https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Smart_elevators]())
where each `elevator` has its own characteristics: (speed per floor, door opening time, stopping time, etc.)
Using a `list of future readings` (ie, an offline algorithm),
we created an algorithm Which mainly takes into account the speed of the elevators
and places each call to a particular elevator so that **the aggregate total waiting time
of all requests is as minimal as possible**

### Literature review.

In our project we used several sources, some of which are:
1. _The Science Behind Elevators -_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOayymoIl8U
2. _Elevator System Design -_ https://youtu.be/siqiJAJWUVg?t=1236
3. _The Hidden Science of Elevators -_ -https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a20986/the-hidden
