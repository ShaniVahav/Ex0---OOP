###### An Off-line Elevator Algorithm

##### Given a building, with a maximum floor and a minimum floor, and with smart elevators (ie: https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Smart_elevators)
##### where each elevator has its own characteristics: (speed per floor, door opening time, stopping time, etc.)
##### Using a list of future readings (ie, an offline algorithm),
##### we created an algorithm Which mainly takes into account the speed of the elevators
##### and places each call to a particular elevator so that the aggregate total waiting time
##### of all requests is as minimal as possible
